Time Complexity Analysis of Dictionary Implementation
Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to the "Time Complexity Analysis of Dictionary Implementation" project, a comprehensive exploration and analysis of a Dictionary class implemented using a binary search tree. Throughout the coding exercises conducted in Weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, we developed and refined this implementation, culminating in a detailed analysis of its time complexity.

Features
Dictionary Class Implementation: Complete code for the Dictionary class, employing a binary search tree for efficient data management and retrieval.
Time Complexity Analysis: In-depth analysis of the time complexity for each core method within the Dictionary class, including lookup, insert, displayEntries, and the class destructor, utilizing Big-O notation.
Extended Functionalities: Additional analysis covering advanced functionalities like remove, displayTree, rotations, and various constructors and assignment operators.
